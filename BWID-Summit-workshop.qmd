## Welcome to the Black Women in Data Summit R workshop today!

In this workshop you'll get started with R, RStudio and the tidyverse. This is a hands on workshop, so you'll have the opportunity to try things out!

This is a short version of a Carpentries workshop. Learn more about [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and their workshops, lessons and instructor training.

**Getting started**

-   Please bring your computer. You won't need to install any software, but for best participation, it's good if you're able to try things out yourself.

-   Go to this Carpentries lesson on "R and the tidyverse for working with data": <https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/r-tidyverse-4-datasets/>

    -   We'll be going through Episodes 1 to 3 in this workshop

-   Connect to the cloud instances for these lessons

    -   Go to [this link for cloud instances](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/286583/join?access_code=vcDAcTYXoytSO_TPSDnLpsCAdt6wNCxUN4uHInEE)

    -   Log on using any email you have. It will authenticate with that email. This is just so each person has their own version to be able to work with.

    -   Once you're there go to the 'BWD-Carpentries' project
